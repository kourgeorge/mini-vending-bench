# Mini Vending Bench

A JavaScript benchmark for testing long-term coherence and decision-making of AI agents through a simulated vending machine business.

Based on the [Vending-Bench](https://andonlabs.com/evals/vending-bench-2) research, this benchmark evaluates AI agents' ability to:
- Manage finances and inventory over multiple days
- Navigate supplier relationships (honest, negotiation-focused, adversarial, unreliable)
- Make strategic pricing and product selection decisions
- Handle uncertainty in demand and supply chain
- Maintain long-term coherence across hundreds of interactions

## Features

- **🤖 OpenAI Models**: Test OpenAI models including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and o1
- **📊 Comprehensive Logging**: JSONL logs for every action, detailed console output, MCP supervisor interaction tracking
- **📈 Chart Data Export**: JSON chart data for balance, sales, and revenue visualization
- **🎭 Realistic Simulation**: Weather effects, price elasticity, day-of-week demand variation
- **💼 Diverse Suppliers**: Honest, negotiation-required, adversarial, and unreliable supplier types
- **🎯 Supervisor Support**: Optional static guidelines or MCP-based supervisor (Wayfound) for performance guidance
- **📊 Web Dashboard**: Real-time leaderboard and run visualization UI
- **⚙️ Self-Contained**: Pure JavaScript, no native dependencies required

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kourgeorge/mini-vending-bench.git
cd mini-vending-bench
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create configuration file:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

4. Edit `config.json` with your API keys:
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "model": "gpt-5-mini",
    "apiKey": "sk-your-openai-key-here"
  },
  "supplier": {
    "model": "gpt-5-mini",
    "apiKey": "sk-your-openai-key-here"
  },
  "simulation": {
    "durationDays": 30,
    "startingBalance": 500,
    "dailyFee": 2,
    "bankruptcyThreshold": 10,
    "maxTurns": 2000,
    "randomSeed": 42
  }
}
```

## Usage

Run the benchmark with a subdirectory and supervisor mode:
```bash
npm start <subdirectory> <supervisor-mode>
```

Supervisor modes:
- `none` - No supervisor (control group with full instructions)
- `static` - Static guidelines in system prompt
- `mcp` - MCP-based supervisor (Wayfound)
- `minimal` - Bare-bones minimal instructions (no detailed guidance)

Examples:
```bash
# Control run (no supervisor, full instructions)
npm start control none

# Minimal instructions run (bare bones prompt)
npm start minimal-test minimal

# Static guidelines run
npm start static-test static

# MCP supervisor run
npm start mcp-test mcp
```

Output will be saved to `run_outputs/<subdirectory>/run_<timestamp>/`

## Web Dashboard

A real-time web UI lets you monitor benchmark runs, compare models, and browse run history.

### Starting the Dashboard

In two separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API server (port 3001)
npm run ui:api

# Terminal 2 — React frontend with hot reload (port 5173)
npm run ui:dev
```

Or, to serve the pre-built UI:

```bash
npm run ui:app
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Dashboard Features

- **Leaderboard**: Ranked table of all runs by final score, with model, supervisor mode, profit, days survived, and cost
- **Run Detail**: Per-run view with daily balance/revenue/sales charts and full agent message log
- **Live Polling**: Active runs update automatically every 3 seconds
- **Benchmark Description**: System architecture diagram and simulation overview

### Supervisor Configuration

You can configure both static and MCP supervisor options in `config.json` and select which one to use via the command line argument.

**Static Guidelines**: Add 5 strategic guidelines directly to the agent's system prompt:
```json
{
  "supervisor": {
    "staticGuidelines": [
      "Maintain cash reserves equal to at least 2x your daily operating costs for reordering flexibility.",
      "Negotiate bulk discounts via email before placing orders to reduce unit costs.",
      "Prioritize high-velocity products (bottled water, chips, candy bars) to maximize turnover.",
      "Adjust pricing based on weather - increase prices for beverages on hot days.",
      "Focus on bank balance growth in the final week - avoid tying up cash in excess inventory."
    ]
  }
}
```

**MCP Supervisor** (Wayfound): Connect to an external supervisor agent for dynamic guidance:
```json
{
  "supervisor": {
    "mcpServer": {
      "url": "https://app.wayfound.ai/mcp",
      "bearerToken": "your-bearer-token-here",
      "supervisorAgentId": "your-supervisor-agent-id",
      "description": "You have access to a supervisor that can provide strategic guidance..."
    }
  }
}
```

Both configurations can be present in `config.json` - the CLI argument determines which is used.

The simulation will:
1. Initialize the vending machine business with starting capital
2. Run the AI agent to make decisions (order products, set prices, restock machine)
3. Simulate customer purchases based on pricing and availability
4. Track all transactions and events
5. Generate final score and chart data

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration
- **model**: Model name (e.g., `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `o1`, or any model served by your LiteLLM proxy)
- **apiKey**: Your API key
- **baseURL** *(optional)*: Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint (see LiteLLM below)

### Supplier Configuration
Suppliers are simulated using a separate LLM to generate realistic email responses.
- **model**: Model name (default: `gpt-5-mini`)
- **apiKey**: Your API key
- **baseURL** *(optional)*: Custom endpoint for the supplier model

### Using LiteLLM or Other OpenAI-Compatible Providers

You can point the benchmark at any OpenAI-compatible API — including [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), Ollama, Azure OpenAI, or other proxies — by setting `baseURL` in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "model": "claude-opus-4-5",
    "apiKey": "anything",
    "baseURL": "http://localhost:4000"
  },
  "supplier": {
    "model": "gpt-5-mini",
    "apiKey": "sk-your-openai-key-here"
  }
}
```

This lets you benchmark non-OpenAI models (Anthropic Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.) through a LiteLLM proxy while keeping the supplier on a standard OpenAI model.

### Simulation Parameters
- **durationDays**: Number of days to simulate (default: 30)
- **startingBalance**: Initial bank balance in dollars (default: 500)
- **dailyFee**: Daily location rent/maintenance fee (default: 2)
- **bankruptcyThreshold**: Minimum balance threshold (default: 10)
- **maxTurns**: Maximum agent actions before timeout (default: 2000)
- **randomSeed**: Seed for reproducible randomness (optional)

## Output

Each run creates a directory in `run_outputs/<subdirectory>/run_[timestamp]/` containing:

### Files
- **state.json**: Final simulation state
- **config.json**: Configuration used (API keys sanitized)
- **final_score.json**: Final metrics and score
- **messages.jsonl**: All agent messages
- **tool_calls.jsonl**: All tool calls and results
- **events.jsonl**: Simulation events
- **daily_summary.jsonl**: Daily performance summary
- **trace.txt**: Human-readable trace (if enabled)

### Chart Data
- **balance_chart_data.json**: Bank balance over time data
- **units_sold_chart_data.json**: Daily units sold data
- **revenue_chart_data.json**: Revenue over time data

These JSON files can be imported into any charting library (Chart.js, D3.js, Plotly, etc.) for visualization.

## Available Tools

The agent has access to these tools:

### Financial Tools
- `get_balance`: Check current bank balance and financial summary
- `view_transactions`: View transaction history with filters

### Time Tools
- `get_current_date`: Get current simulation day and weather
- `wait_for_next_day`: Advance to next day (triggers customer purchases and deliveries)

### Research Tools
- `get_available_products`: See all products with wholesale/retail prices
- `search_suppliers`: Find suppliers by product

### Email Tools
- `view_inbox`: View email inbox
- `read_email`: Read specific email
- `send_email`: Email suppliers (generates LLM-powered response)
- `place_order`: Place order with supplier (costs money)

### Inventory Tools
- `get_storage_inventory`: View warehouse inventory
- `check_deliveries`: Check pending and recent deliveries

### Vending Machine Tools
- `view_vending_machine`: See machine inventory and configuration
- `restock_machine`: Move products from warehouse to machine
- `set_price`: Change product prices
- `empty_slot`: Remove products from machine

## Supplier Types

The benchmark includes 4 types of suppliers with different behaviors:

### Honest Suppliers
- Fair, transparent pricing
- Reliable delivery
- Straightforward communication

### Negotiation-Focused Suppliers
- Start with higher prices
- Expect and reward negotiation
- Build relationships with regular customers

### Adversarial Suppliers
- Try to maximize profit at customer expense
- May use manipulative tactics
- Might have hidden fees or unclear terms

### Unreliable Suppliers
- Lowest prices
- Inconsistent service
- May have delays or quality issues

## Scoring

Agents are evaluated on:
- **Net Worth**: Final balance + inventory value + cash in machine
- **Profit**: Total revenue - total expenses
- **Units Sold**: Total customer purchases
- **Days Survived**: Number of days before bankruptcy or completion

## Architecture

### Two-Model System
- **Agent Model**: The OpenAI model being tested (configurable)
- **Supplier Model**: Generates realistic supplier responses (default: gpt-5-mini)

This separation ensures:
- Consistent supplier behavior across different agent models
- Fair comparison between agents
- Realistic adversarial challenges

### State Management
- Single `state.json` file stores entire simulation state
- All tools read/write to centralized state
- Enables full reproducibility and analysis

### Simulation Engine
- **Price Elasticity**: Customers less likely to buy overpriced items
- **Weather Effects**: Hot days increase demand, rainy days decrease
- **Day-of-Week Variation**: Weekends have higher traffic
- **Variety Bonus**: More product types attract more customers

## Example Run
